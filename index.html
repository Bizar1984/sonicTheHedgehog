              Sonic the Hedgehog, trademarked Sonic The Hedgehog, is a blue
              anthropomorphic hedgehog and the main protagonist of the series.
              Developed as a replacement for their existing Alex Kidd mascot, as
              well as Sega's response to Mario, his first appearance was in the
              arcade game Rad Mobile as a cameo, before making his official
              debut in Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). Sonic's greatest ability is
              his running speed, and he is known as the world's fastest
              hedgehog. Using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes
              Super Sonic and can achieve even greater speeds.

              Miles Prower, better known by his nickname Tails, is a two-tailed
              fox who is Sonic's best friend and sidekick. His name is a pun on
              "miles per hour". He is able to use his two tails to propel
              himself into the air like a helicopter for a limited time. Yasushi
              Yamaguchi, originally the main artist and zone designer for Sega's
              Sonic Team, designed Tails for an internal competition for a
              sidekick to Sonic. His first appearance was in Sonic 2 for the
              Game Gear, where he was kidnapped by Doctor Robotnik for a "hefty"
              ransom, and was first made playable in the Genesis version of
              Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Tails has appeared in almost every Sonic
              game since his first appearance. Tails starred in two solo spinoff
              games for the Sega Game Gear in 1995 - Tails' Skypatrol, and Tails
              Adventure. Frequently portrayed as a sweet-natured and humble fox,
              Tails used to be picked on because of his twin tails, before he
              met Sonic. Tails has a very high IQ and excellent mechanical
              ability.

              Knuckles the Echidna is a red echidna and Sonic's friendly rival.
              First introduced in the Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 3,
              Knuckles lives on Angel Island, which hovers in the sky due to the
              power of the Master Emerald. As the last surviving member of the
              Echidna people who once inhabited the island, his duty is to guard
              the Master Emerald.

              Doctor Ivo Robotnik, better known by his alias Doctor Eggman, is a
              human mad scientist and the main antagonist of the series.
              Debuting in the first game of the series, Sonic the Hedgehog, he
              was shown attempting to collect the Chaos Emeralds and turn all of
              the animals inhabiting the land into robots. He is a
              self-proclaimed or certifiable genius with an IQ of 300. His
              fondness for mechas has made him a renowned authority on robotics.
              Ultimately, Eggman's goal is to conquer the world and create his
              ultimate utopia, Eggmanland, alternatively known as the Eggman
              Empire and Robotnikland.
